Project: Build a Portfolio Site 

Goal is to create a portfolio site with HTML, CSS, & javascript following this design mockup: 
https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf


Encouraged to implement custom changes to the design (colors, interactivity, etc) rather than fierce adherence to the design mockup.
