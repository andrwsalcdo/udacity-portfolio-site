Build a Portfolio Site Project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

Goal is to create a portfolio site with HTML, CSS, & javascript following this design mockup: 
https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf

Some features include: 
  -Name, Logo Image
  -Hero image
  -Featured works-
    -Project 1,2,etc
    -images, links

Encouraged to implement custom design rather than fierce adherence to the design mockup.
